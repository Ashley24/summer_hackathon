            <p>Welcome to the The Last Wave, </p>
            <p>It was a fine day at the beach and I wanted to ride the waves for one last time. </p>
            <p>As a farewell to Summer almost coming to an end. I saw some mysterious things (Find out in the game. What these things are?) coming to reek havoc
             on the shore. It was up to me to let the craze of these mysterious things come to a final end. Proceed to the game, lets see if you've the power to stop the creatures from ruining the shore.
             Good Luck! </p>
